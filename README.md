# CLASSIFICATION-OF-BASIC-EMOTIONS-USING-BERT

## Authors
A. Artemov, A. Veselovskiy

## Annotation

In this article, we describe a GAN system and its construction process for detecting the vector of 7 emotions in the text. The system is based on a manually marked up dataset, cleaned from data collisions.

## Datasets
The datasets folder contains dataset files:


- `dataset_full_175742.csv` - source dataset

- `dataset_manual_matching.csv` - dataset marked up by people

- `dataset_with_collisions.npy` - dataset with collisions

- `dataset_without_collisions.npy` - dataset without collisions (golden)
